Example That 100 Mb s plan? You re actually getting 12.5 MB s download speed. They re not lying but it s misleading AF. Most people hear 100 and assume it s 100 megabytes . EDIT No one said it s new and yes ISPs worldwide use bits but that doesn t make it not misleading. The point is they count on the average person not knowing the difference just because it s common practice doesn t mean it s not manipulative.",
