The balance allows you to make phone calls and texts, and the \"bonus\" balance they give you literally does nothing. Best way is to just recharge it again, to recharge connection only you do the normal recharge process but then when you put in the recharge code you put 3 after it to add data only. If you recharge more than 50dh at once you get double, so if you recharge 50dh you get 10gb so def do that if you use a lot. You can just go to any moul hanout and ask for a recharge card and if they have the rapid one where you give them your phone number and they do it that's even better. If you're really in a bind you can use the dirham balance to get a video pass which will let you use google youtube spotify, but be warned, once it runs out, even if you have a 4g balance it will block google youtube spotify but everything else works. It's sooooo stupid. The only two solutions are adding another video pass which prolongs the process or just wait for the video pass to expire. Anyways inwi sucks lol. Lmk if you have any more questions",

I have no clue who this could be, or how they got my number as even I don't know what my number is my phone just says \"unknown\". It's especially odd as I received the messages at around midnight. Any idea what this could be?"

Should I pay the months I was not there to resume the internet or can I just pay current month? thanks a lot",
