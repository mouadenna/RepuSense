Example That 100 Mb s plan? You re actually getting 12.5 MB s download speed. They re not lying but it s misleading AF. Most people hear 100 and assume it s 100 megabytes . EDIT No one said it s new and yes ISPs worldwide use bits but that doesn t make it not misleading. The point is they count on the average person not knowing the difference just because it s common practice doesn t mean it s not manipulative.",

The balance allows you to make phone calls and texts, and the \"bonus\" balance they give you literally does nothing. Best way is to just recharge it again, to recharge connection only you do the normal recharge process but then when you put in the recharge code you put 3 after it to add data only. If you recharge more than 50dh at once you get double, so if you recharge 50dh you get 10gb so def do that if you use a lot. You can just go to any moul hanout and ask for a recharge card and if they have the rapid one where you give them your phone number and they do it that's even better. If you're really in a bind you can use the dirham balance to get a video pass which will let you use google youtube spotify, but be warned, once it runs out, even if you have a 4g balance it will block google youtube spotify but everything else works. It's sooooo stupid. The only two solutions are adding another video pass which prolongs the process or just wait for the video pass to expire. Anyways inwi sucks lol.

After talking with Inwi support, they tried to tell me I could convert the Dirham recharge to a data recharge with the Convert'n feature and they gave me a 120 code to use. Well they were wrong about that. This convert feature is for enterprise accounts and only converts unused talk time hours to data gigabytes. With a Dirham recharge you don't have any actual voice hours. When they couldn't explain why it kept failing they said go to one of their branches, the closest being over 4 hours a way. Nope. So for anyone else reading this, if you want data only you have to use the 3 on the recharge. Do it as mentioned above in the other post or, like I did, put the inwi app on your phone, navigate to the data package you want and when it asks for payment choose the scratcher code and enter it then.",

Typically, the process can involve using some specific software applications like Rufus or Etcher to create a bootable drive. However, since this device primarily operates as a tablet, you might need to check if it recognizes the microSD in a way that allows booting. Have you already tried connecting the microSD to your PC first to create the bootable image? It might be easier to use a laptop or desktop to format and prepare the microSD before inserting it back into your tablet. Also, what operating system are you looking to boot from the microSD? That could influence how you go about the process. Would love to hear your thoughts!",

Difference is day and night. If you're not using the landline, you should be able to switch to 8mbps for less money or 12mbps for the same price. If they refuse and you have fulfilled the explicit term of your contract typically 1 or 2 year then you can just ask them to end your current contract and then immediately subscribe to a new plan.

    "text":"All the mobile 4g subscriptions claiming unlimited 4G data are actually limited. By unlimited, they mean you will never be disconnected offline . But they only \"guarantee\" 4g speeds for a specific quota. I believe orange has a monthly quota, and inwi has a daily one, or the opposite. The only 4G boxes that are actually unlimited are business enterprise . Personally, I use Orange Business Box got it using my company papers , and I pay 349 dh month. It's actually pretty awesome! My connection speed never dips below 85mbps even in peak hours. My average is actually 150 - 165 mbps, and early morning I even reach 240 mbps sometimes, but it's rare. I've had months where I downloaded close to 6TB of data without issues. Here's the link if you wanna look into it A company Registre commerce is mandatory for this.",

Apart from the major cities, internet is basically dogshit in most of the country unless you pay exorbitant amounts of money.. and I've always wondered.... why Moroccan's of all people, with all their ingenuity, are seemingly contented with the offerings available to them instead of figuring out how to upgrade things themselves. I'm naive perhaps, but how much would it cost to crowdsource a private network that exceeded the 200mb threshold? If you factor in how much people and businesses are paying already, does it not seem likely that a new player could disrupt and push the market forward?",
