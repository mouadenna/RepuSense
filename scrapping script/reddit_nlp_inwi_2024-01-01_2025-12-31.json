You‚Äôre actually getting 12.5 MB/s download speed.\n\nThey‚Äôre not lying but it‚Äôs misleading AF. Most people hear ‚Äú100‚Äù and assume it‚Äôs 100 megabytes ü§ì.\n\nEDIT: No one said it‚Äôs new and yes ISPs worldwide use bits but that doesn‚Äôt make it not misleading.\n\nThe point is: they count on the average person not knowing the difference just because it‚Äôs common practice doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not manipulative.\n\n",

Hard drives have a write and read speeds of 100MB/s to even 300MB/s, and ssd which are more common today have speeds from 400MB/s to 14000MB/s, that said there are other bottlenecks like cpu speed if you're decompressing the files while downloading like steam does, and more importantly the local network speed, some people will not benefit from the new speed because even though they hav 200mb/s internet their router is only 100mb/s ethernet or 2.4ghz wifi.",

      "hasn't it been like this even before this new offer?",
      "Yes üòÉ you can notice in the ads that they write Mb not MB",

      "yes ISPs worldwide use bits but that doesn‚Äôt make it not misleading.",
      "that's not new though... ISP's all over the world have been doing this since forever gigabit was never 1gigabyte per second.. it's more like 250MB/s",
      "More like 125MB/s = 1000/8",

      "This is the way it's done worldwide. You always divide speed by 8 to get the download speed.",
      "Dude that‚Äôs done everywhere and the speed given to customers is the correct one",
      "correct but how it‚Äôs marketed is what confuses non tech consumers.",
      "non tech consumers have no idea what Mb nor MB mean.\n\nthey don't even know their download speed and wouldn't notice anything - all they care about is their whatsapp calls, Netflix shows and youtube videos. If they all load instantly, that's their limit",
      "Yeah it's been this way forever... ISPs always advertise in megabits not megabytes everywhere.\nTechnically accurate, but they know some people might confuse the two and it might come as misleading if you don't know the difference.",
      "This is normal globally, Canada &amp; UK do the same. \n\nEveryone doing speedtests though are probably testing their internet speeds within Morocco or the continent, but the majority of data-centers (gaming is a big one) are hosted in Europe or the Middle East. Morocco are working on expanding their capacity across borders but unless you're downloading items that are cached inside Morocco or using Moroccan services, increasing internet speeds might saturate this link.\n\nYou're looking at a difference of 100Gbps capacity in Morocco ([via Casablanca](https://www.peeringdb.com/ix/2713)) vs 72Tbps in the UK for example.",

      "Exactly, everyone is aware of it and those who are not aware, don't even know their download speed and don't feel mislead cause they don't even notice the \"misleading\" thing",
      "LOL, that's **not** misleading at all. that's literally how it works. and yes an average person that is not acquainted with how Networks work then they would assume that their down speed would be 100mbytes/sec but in reality they are paying for 100mbites/sec. Also why would an ISP would explain any of that? anyways, this is very basic. but sure, you did an okay job at clarifying to those whom aren't aware.",
      "\"That's how it works\" isn‚Äôt an excuse it‚Äôs exactly why it's misleading.\n\nISPs advertise layer 1/2 throughput to consumers who interpret it as application layer transfer rate which are 1/8th of what‚Äôs advertised. That‚Äôs a  marketing sleigh of hand, not transparency.\n\nYou‚Äôre right that it's basic networking‚Äîbut the average user doesn‚Äôt operate at OSI Layer 1 or 2. They see download speed ls at Layer 7, in megabytes. \n\nAnd no ISP's not explaining that to the average consumer.\n\nSo yes, it‚Äôs misleading.",

      "It‚Äôs the case worldwide. \nGenerally, bits are used for bandwidth, whereas bytes are used for disk read/write (storage).",
      "1Megabye = 8 Megabit\nIt always been this way",

      "This is so cute You're like a child who discovered something that all grown ups know but thinks it's a big misleading idea that everyone falls for and he tries to blow it wide open and explain it to everyone lol i mean this in the nicest way by the way hhhhh its actually sweet",

      "i have it for a looong time, since they started, i used to game with it.\n\nfor the first 2 years it was probably the best internet provider i have ever used, veeery stable, zero problems.\n\nand than they decided to change something, ping is all over the place, packet loss is more like a bitcoin chart.\n\ni still use it but mainly when im not near a stable wifi.\n\n15gb&amp;1hour for 50dhs is a very good deal for me",
      "That's true, it's very cheap, i'm using it over 2 years now",
      "Yeah, some online games can't even operate with win.\nAlso, weird behaviour woth whatsapp : You only receive msg if you enter app or after a long time, like if 4G has a sleep mode and do period wake ups to receive updates. ..",
      "I have been a customer of Win for more than four years now. Never had one single problem.",
      "Hey so I‚Äôm a new customer I received my sim card yesterday and activated it lbar7 and it says that time left one working day for portability, how much does it usually take to change numbers if u have an idea and how much to activate offre?",

      "Valid crash out",
      "Pro: the deal is real, it's the cheapest mobile data (15GB and 1h of talk for 50dh) and mostly performs well. If you use up your monthly data, you can seamlessly move into the next package as if you had bought it at the beginning of the month, which is really nice! Speeds are satisfactory when the network doesn't hang. \n\nCon: at times unreliable: WhatsApp calls and messages don't come through, everything takes 10 seconds to load instead of tenth of a second, and sometimes it absolutely refuses to work with my VPN. Very frustrating. \n\nWhen this month ends I'll go back to IAM for 5GB/50dh to see if the performance is more reliable, since most of the time I didn't even use more than 5GB. Since it is month by month, it's no problem.",
      "Yep just said the same on a nother comment.\n\nMy main issues has been this :\n1. Whatsapp\n2. Few games not working with win network\n3. Some corporate VPN can't connect\n4. Sometimes, would struggle with DNS resolution, and forcing it to use google DNS 8.8.8.8 will result in full internet blocage\n\n\nOverall it is still good value for price and the flexibility to change subscription plan is unmatched. Orange has a similar concept with YOXO but Orange coverage is just awful.",
      "The price compared with what you get is a good value, however they have one of the worst and quite scary customer support i‚Äôve ever seen..\n\nSo basically one day i had a problem with my internet so i reach out to them to solve it.\n\nAt first everything was normal, they asked me their usual useless questions like what‚Äôs my email and name and stuff‚Ä¶.\n\nWe talked a bit but it was all in vain, they told me that my request is sent to the department of something like they always do\nThe scary part is the following, after some time of talking I realized that the typing animation appeared for quite a while(a solid 30-40 seconds) and no message was sent by them, and out of curiosity I looked at my front camera and i did the ‚úåüèªsign just for fun, then a paragraph appeared and disappeared so quickly, and all my eyes could catch from that paragraph is:\n( Mr Houssaine dok joj sba3‚Ä¶‚Ä¶) \nI immediately shutdown my phone, my heart sank, I couldn‚Äôt believe it, how tf a company that provides telecom services can spy on people like that.\n\nIt‚Äôs unacceptable and illegal, what guarantees that they‚Äôre not spying on you right now reading this\nSeeing what you‚Äôre doing, and hearing what you‚Äôre saying.\n\nThis is tough people, turn off camera access from any application you have on your phone as well as microphone.\n\nGo watch a tutorial if you don‚Äôt know how, make sometime for your own privacy, god knows what these monsters can do with your informations.\nStay safe my friend.",
      "Lol, I checked the win app on play store and it actually asks for Camera/storage permission (maybe to send photo id?). Always deny permissions for apps that don't need your data.",
      "Yeaah they ask for permission to send them some photos if needed but not the camera or the microphone, even when I checked in settings, there is no permission for camera.",
      "why is mobile services so expensive in Morocco? we need real competition.",
      "Used it from 2020 to 2023. \n\nThey migrated my number from my former T√©l√©com operator flawlessly and delivered the new sim card to my door step.\n\nAfter that it was very nice to have the option to change the number of hours and data plan every month if I needed to. I could add more GB to my data plan or hours for calling according to what I needed to do the next month.\n\nPayment online only failed once and then I got reimbursement.\n\nIf you don't mind inwi's network coverage, then it's probably the best way to manage your sim currently if you looking for a 100% online experience.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a current employee of Inwi but I wasn't at the time when I was a Win customer.",

      "0/10. It was working fine for 4 months and then my line got disconected without any reason. And given that they dont have any physical location you can go to and complain, the problem didnt get resolved. All i could do is chat with someone on their app, each time the person is different and they say your problem is getting treated without any actual results. I tried for like 3 months and then i gave up and threw their sim card. I totally dont recommend."

    "comments": [
      "And before you ask moul hanout had no idea how tf to use it... one of them said \"tfilaw 3lik\" and the other one said \"wlad l7hram hadchi machi b7al tesalat\" LOL",
      "Did you ever figure this out? I have the exact same situation and I am nowhere remotely close to an inwi branch. \n\nI have tried to buy every package imaginable with my inwi balance and they all return error of insufficient balance. What is the balance even for?  Makes no sense. I just want data only.",
      "I did actually figure it out. Basically we fucked up and that balance can only be used for talk + text and you can buy a \"video pass\" that lets you use youtube and spotify which sucks. The balance allows you to make phone calls and texts, and the \"bonus\" balance they give you literally does nothing.\n\nBest way is to just recharge it again, to recharge connection only you do the normal recharge process but then when you put in the recharge code you put \\*3 after it to add data only. If you recharge more than 50dh at once you get double, so if you recharge 50dh you get 10gb so def do that if you use a lot. You can just go to any moul hanout and ask for a recharge card and if they have the rapid one (where you give them your phone number and they do it) that's even better.\n\nIf you're really in a bind you can use the dirham balance to get a video pass which will let you use google + youtube + spotify, but be warned, once it runs out, even if you have a 4g balance it will block google + youtube + spotify but everything else works. It's sooooo stupid. The only two solutions are adding another video pass which prolongs the process or just wait for the video pass to expire. Anyways inwi sucks lol. Lmk if you have any more questions",
      "Thanks this is exactly what happened. After talking with Inwi support, they tried to tell me I could convert the Dirham recharge to a data recharge with the Convert'n feature and they gave me a *120 code to use. Well they were wrong about that. This convert feature is for enterprise accounts and only converts unused talk time hours to data gigabytes. With a Dirham recharge you don't have any actual voice hours. When they couldn't explain why it kept failing they said go to one of their branches, the closest being over 4 hours a way. Nope.\n\nSo for anyone else reading this, if you want data only you have to use the *3 on the recharge. Do it as mentioned above in the other post or, like I did, put the inwi app on your phone, navigate to the data package you want and when it asks for payment choose the scratcher code and enter it then.",

      "I don't have any use for calls - nonetheless I'm p sure it just tells me I have no minutes when I try calling anyway lol.",
      "I guess because its a bonus, you can only use the amount you paid to 4G but not the bonus you had from your recharge, i recommend you to switch your number to win by inwi its good and really cheap comparing to normal inwi sim card",
      "If you are living in Morocco! I am not sure if you are a tourist if it works or not",
      "So I didn't pay anything to 4g, the card came with 20dh initial and I added a 50dh card to the account. Then they gave me the bonus which i dont care about. I'm guessing this is where I messed up because I didn't add it to the 4g specifically. Idk am I basically just screwed out of that 50dh card now?",
      "Yeah exactly you have chosen the normal way it will give you 1250dh + 500Mo 4g if you need 4G you need to add *3 to the serial number and you will get 10 Go 4g access",
      "If it doesn't work on *120 *10# pass it's just a bonus (I didn't know they still do this since I moved to forfait a long time ago)\n\nBasically the bonus is at least the amount of the recharge. It went up to x25 at a time (10=250). I remember you can't use it to buy pass but directly (for calls/internet) once your pass runs out. But ofc it runs out very quickly.",
      "How can I use the 50dh card I added then? I don't even care about the bonus atp. I added the card by doing *120# and then choosing the 6: Recharge option (i think this is where I screwed up). I already had 20dh that came with the sim card and then the 1200 bonus which is bs..",
      "Yeah I think it's no longer possible to choose an internet/calls pass after doing recharge. Only r√©seaux sociaux and other bs",
      "Your local inwi branch will probably give you better information than reddit.\n\nIs this actually paid balance or some kind of points/bonus that you acquired?",

Typically, the process can involve using some specific software applications like Rufus or Etcher to create a bootable drive. However, since this device primarily operates as a tablet, you might need to check if it recognizes the microSD in a way that allows booting.\n\nHave you already tried connecting the microSD to your PC first to create the bootable image? It might be easier to use a laptop or desktop to format and prepare the microSD before inserting it back into your tablet. \n\nAlso, what operating system are you looking to boot from the microSD? That could influence how you go about the process. Would love to hear your thoughts!"

      "GPT : Maroc Telecom (IAM) and Inwi have entered into a strategic partnership to share their fiber optic infrastructure in Morocco. In March 2025, the two operators agreed to create two joint ventures‚ÄîFiberCo and TowerCo‚Äîeach owned equally (50/50). FiberCo is dedicated to expanding fiber optic networks, aiming to connect 1 million homes within two years and 3 million within five years   \nI think that won't be a problem anymore",

      "Finally, I found the solution with the JumiaPay app.\n\nThe registration process is a bit complicated, everything is in French.\n\nThey will send you an SMS code to complete the registration. They only accept numbers from certain countries, otherwise the SMS code will never arrive. I suppose they only accept numbers from Morocco or Africa.\n\nAfter registration, you can pay without fees and with a credit card. I used my Revolut card and it worked."

Since I think it would be best to have unlimited data, i've narrowed it down to the Orange Dar Box 4G+ and the INWI Vacay Wifi/I-Dar. \n\nHas anyone had experience with either of these services? Which one would you recommend or maybe another? Thanks!",

Somehow, this can be circumvented with PairVPN, though it's a bit of a hassle.\n\n  \nIf you're working with web apps, or googling a lot, the limited rate can hurt.\n\n  \nI wouldn't bother buying a box, just insert the sim card in a phone."

Statt ein Annuit√§tendarlehen zu tilgen, bespart man einen Bausparvertrag, bis dieser zuteilungsreif ist und zahlt die Zinsen einer Vorfinanzierung. Danach l√∂sen Bausparguthaben und Bauspardarlehen die Vorfinanzierung ab und man zahlt nur noch die deutlich geringeren Zinsen auf das Darlehen.\n\nDas muss man halt im Detail durchrechnen und da vorsichtig sein. Der Vorteil bei Vorfinanzierung+Bausparvertrag ist, dass man schon jetzt wei√ü, welche geringen Zinsen man sp√§ter zahlt. Es kann jedoch teurer sein, da das monatlich gesparte Geld nur rumliegt. Beim klassischen Annuit√§tendarlehen sinken die Schulden und so tilgt man bei konstanter Rate immer einen steigenden Betrag.\n\nEs kann g√ºnstiger sein, eine bestimmte Zeit eine Annuit√§tendarlehen abzuzahlen, solange man Zinsbindung hat, und w√§hrenddessen einen kleineren Bausparvertrag zu besparen, der ausreicht, um die Restschuld des Annuit√§tendarlehen abzul√∂sen.\n\nAber was wei√ü ich schon.

      "Skip adsl, it's an old and very outdated technology. Go for optic fiber",
      "I agree with you actually, but I can't pay more than 200.  \nI think 4Mbps is enough for me, I may reduce that 200 hahaha",
      "Just to put things into perspective, the difference between the 4mb adsl plan and the 20mn fiber one is like using an iphone 3gs in 2025 compared to an iphone 12 in 2025. Sure you can get calls and basic messaging but thats about it. \n\nI'd be surprised if youtube is doable in a 4mb internet without buffering.\n\nThe 200dh for the 4mb is so bad it makes the already bad 250 for the 20mb fiber plan good smh.",
      "hell and i'm here thinking 100mbps isn't enough for me",
      "Really? I wonder what use cases 100mbps is not enough for.",
      "honestly it is pretty fast but not when it comes to downloading large files.. 100mbps can get pretty slow especially gaming with some games taking up 100Gb for a single game and they get a lot of updates",
      "Yeah i feel you, I also hate that part, especially seeing a streamer download it in a few minutes.\n\nBut oh well even with 200mbps which the max we can get AFAIK its still gonna take too long to download big games. The jump won't even be worth it.",
      "it's annoying as hell seeing my online friends in France having 1gbps for literally 30‚Ç¨ a month when we have to pay 50‚Ç¨ for 100mbps not to mention that being in Africa we have horrible latency in practically all games since all servers are either in Europe which is best case scenario or all the way in America so we get absolutely horrible latency",
      "Dude I have 3gbps/s fiber and sometimes, it's still not enough.\n\nI do have special use cases tho whee I deal with multi-terrabyte diles, but still.\n\nAlso, nice username.",
      "I'll find out if there are any better packages with the same price.",
      "new offers appeared",
      "IDK about switching packages, but I would skip ADSL altogether.\n\nCheck if they have fiber at your address. IAM's AFAIK start at 500 MAD/mo for 100mbps. [Orange](https://www.orange.ma/WiFi-a-la-Maison/Fibre-d-Orange/Offres-Fibre-d-Orange) and [Inwi](https://inwi.ma/particuliers/offres-internet/wifi-a-la-maison/fibre-optique) have offers that start at 250 MAD/mo for 20mbps IIRC. Call all three, check which have service at your address and shop around.\n\nIf able, I strongly recommend getting fiber over ADSL. Difference is day and night.\n\nIf you're not using the landline, you should be able to switch to 8mbps for less money or 12mbps for the same price. If they refuse and you have fulfilled the explicit term of your contract (typically 1 or 2 year) then you can just ask them to end your current contract and then immediately subscribe to a new plan.\nServing 4mbps for 200 MAD/mo in 2025 should be illegal. IAM is a garbage company.",
      "The contract was made since long ago, so I may make a new one.  \nI'll contact their CS support to ask if they accept switch or not.  \nThanks for sharing these info",
      "Go get some Orange or Inwi ADSL offer, it's the same ADSL infrastructure for all, but with 200 DH you get the highest speed possible to your location (up to 20M), and 2 hours of calls to cell phones, unlimited to other home phones.\n\nOr add 50 DH, and get some decent fiber if it's ready in your location.",
      "I'm scared to change Maroc Telecom honestly.  \nSince I've heard some customers' bad experiences with these other providers in my city",

      "Thanks for the recommendation  \nI'll consider that",
      "I have inwi adsl 20mb for 200dh, i just did a speed test it is in 7.4mb with three phones connected to the wifi. I have it for more than a year and half\nIt used to be better +12mb.  But it's the cheapest i live in a 4th floor building i'm in the ground floor it cuts off sometimes for like a 1 minute and comes back.\nSome neighbors who live in the 4th floor they strugle with it, it becomes so slow for them they can't even watch a movie.\nAs a conclusion inwi is the cheapest 20mb for 200dh\nBut it's not stable especially if you have 5 or more devices connected to the wifi. But i think it's better than iam, also orange has 20mb for 200\nI will never go back to iam 4mb for 200dh",
      "So I think it's a most to have Inwi in this case  \nI'll consider that  \nThank you",
      "Box is good, could go up to 100m sometimes, but you only get 40GB for 200 mad, after it's finished it gets down to 10 max, pretty good deal compared ro this one i would say",
      "I actually prefer unlimited internet plans  \nand I think Orange and Inwi offer some good packages of that",
      "It's unlimited, as i said you get 40gb of 100m /s or so, after you use 40gb, the speed goes down to 10m or so give or take, internet is still there, just not 100, but yes inwi i believe has a 350 deal, which is better than this whole thing, or orange cpe if you have the entrepreneur status",
